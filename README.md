# Project to create a Progressive Web App

For this frontend project I followed a code-along video: [Build and Deploy a React PWA ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaJqMcOMuDM) to create a Progressive Web App.  It utilises:
* React to create the single page application
* axios to enable fetching from a weather api [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/api)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
